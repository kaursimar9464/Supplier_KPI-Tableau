# Supplier KPI Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing key procurement performance metrics across multiple suppliers. The dataset includes detailed procurement records such as delivery status, cost savings, compliance rates, and defective units. The goal is to support decision-making by identifying high-performing suppliers and areas for improvement.
